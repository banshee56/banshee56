### Hey there

I'm Bansharee, a Comp Sci major of Dartmouth's class of 2024. My pronouns are she/her/hers.

I currently live in Hanover, New Hampshire but I'm from Dhaka, Bangladesh. I love creating pixel sprites, eating Bengali food, and learning more about anything in tech!

ï¼  me: bansharee.ireen.24@dartmouth.edu.
